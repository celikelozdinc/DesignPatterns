# WHY DO WE NEED?
+ Prototyping &rarr; Creating/Copying cheaply with the help of an *already constructed* or *pre-initialzed* object. 
+ Prototype &rarr; Template of a before *actual* object is constructed.
+ Prototype &rarr; Partially/Fully initialized object that you make a *copy* of.
+ A prototype pattern is used in software development when the type of objects to create is determined by a `prototypical instance`, which is cloned to produce new objects.
+ Instantiate a class by **copying/cloning**, the properties of existing object, creating and independent clone.
    + The new object is exact copy of the prototype but *permits modification* **without altering the original**.
+ To control class instantiation and object generation.
+ To copy the object _state_
