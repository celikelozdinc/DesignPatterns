# WHY DO WE NEED?
+ A prototype pattern is used in software development when the type of objects to create is determined by a `prototypical instance`, which is cloned to produce new objects.
+ This pattern is used, for example, when the **inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the new keyword) is prohibitively expensive** for a given application.
